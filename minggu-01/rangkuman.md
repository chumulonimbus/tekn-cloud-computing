### Cloud Computing
Cloud computing is on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage (cloud storage) and computing power, without direct active management by the user 

### Value preposition
Advocates of public and hybrid clouds claim that cloud computing allows companies to avoid or minimize up-front IT infrastructure costs.

### Market
According to International Data Corporation (IDC), the global spending on cloud computing services has reached $706 billion and expected to reach $1.3 trillion by 2025. While Gartner expected that global public spending would reach $600 billion in 2023.

### History
#### Early history
During the 1960s, the initial concepts of time-sharing became popularized via Remote Job Entry (RJE). this terminology was mostly associated with large vendors such as IBM and DEC. In the 1990s, telecommunications companies, who previously offered primarily dedicated point-to-point data circuits, began offering virtual private network (VPN) services with comparable quality of service, but at a lower cost.

#### 2000s
In July 2002, Amazon created subsidiary Amazon Web Services, with the goal to "enable developers to build innovative and entrepreneurial applications on their own." In March 2006 Amazon introduced its Simple Storage Service (S3), followed by Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) in August of the same year. In April 2008, Google released the beta version of Google App Engine. The App Engine was a PaaS (one of the first of its kind) which provided fully maintained infrastructure and a deployment platform for users to create web applications using common languages/technologies such as Python, Node.js and PHP.

#### 2010s
In February 2010, Microsoft released Microsoft Azure, which had been announced in October 2008. In July 2010, Rackspace Hosting and NASA jointly launched an open-source cloud-software initiative known as OpenStack. The OpenStack project intended to help organizations offering cloud-computing services running on standard hardware. On March 1, 2011, IBM announced the IBM SmartCloud framework to support Smarter Planet. Among the various components of the Smarter Computing foundation, cloud computing is a critical part. On June 7, 2012, Oracle announced the Oracle Cloud. In May 2012, Google Compute Engine was released in preview, before being rolled out into General Availability in December 2013. In 2019, Linux was the most common OS used on Microsoft Azure. In December 2019, Amazon announced AWS Outposts, which is a fully managed service that extends AWS infrastructure, AWS services, APIs, and tools to virtually any customer datacenter, co-location space, or on-premises facility for a truly consistent hybrid experience.

### Characteristics
Cloud computing has main characteristics such as Cost reductions are claimed by cloud providers, Device and location independence, Maintenance of cloud environment is easier, Performance is monitored by IT experts, Productivity may be increased when multiple users can work on the same data simultaneously.

### Service models
Cloud computing offers three service models as follow Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS)

#### Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) refers to online services that provide high-level APIs used to abstract various low-level details of underlying network infrastructure like physical computing resources, location, data partitioning, scaling, security, backup, etc.

#### Platform as a Service (PaaS)
PaaS vendors offer a development environment to application developers. The provider typically develops toolkit and standards for development and channels for distribution and payment. In the PaaS models, cloud providers deliver a computing platform, typically including an operating system, programming-language execution environment, database, and the web server. Application developers develop and run their software on a cloud platform instead of directly buying and managing the underlying hardware and software layers.

#### Software as a Service (SaaS)
In the software as a service (SaaS) model, users gain access to application software and databases. Cloud providers manage the infrastructure and platforms that run the applications. SaaS is sometimes referred to as "on-demand software" and is usually priced on a pay-per-use basis or using a subscription fee. In the SaaS model, cloud providers install and operate application software in the cloud and cloud users access the software from cloud clients. Cloud users do not manage the cloud infrastructure and platform where the application runs.
